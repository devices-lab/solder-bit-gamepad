## Demo code for solder:bit Gamepad

`demo.py` is a Python script that can be flashed to the BBC micro:bit using the the [micro:bit Python Editor](https://python.microbit.org/), or by using [uFlash](https://uflash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) utility and the [MicroPython](https://tech.microbit.org/software/micropython/) runtime.

If you've flashed using the micro:bit Python Editor and are experiencing flickering issues on the NeoPixels, try the following steps to troubleshoot.

1. Use MakeCode to flash the micro:bit with an empty program 
2. Flash the micro:bit with `demo.py` once again, but this time using uFlash instead of the micro:bit Python Editor

## MakeCode extension

[MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) extension is also available for the solder:bit Gamepad - follow the instructions in the [pxt-solderbit-gamepad](https://github.com/devices-lab/pxt-solderbit-gamepad) repository.
