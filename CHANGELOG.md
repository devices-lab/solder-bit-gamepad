## v0.1

### Added

- New KiCad project
- Basic schematic with through-hole symbols/footprints

## v0.2

### Added

- New and improved schematic with SMT
- First PCB layout with surface-mount footprints
- micro:bit edge connector footprint
- Silkscreen graphics similar to micro:bit triangles, labels for buttons

### Changed

- The positioning of the L/R buttons to in-line

### Removed

- Previous footprints with THT

## v0.3

### Added

- Lancaster cityscape graphic on the back of the PCB
- Two bumber buttons
- Larger pads (hand-solder version)

### Changed

- Renamed the buttons L/R to X/Y
- Modified micro:bit edge connector
- Placed X/Y buttons in a diagonal layout

### Removed

- Silkscreen graphics similar to micro:bit triangles

## v0.4

### Added

- Devices Lab logo and footprint
- Two more buttons for a complete D-pad

### Changed

- Moved the X/Y buttons into a diagonal layout
- Improved the micro:bit edge connector
- New silkscreen labels and font
- Made the entire PCB larger to accommodate the new and improved micro:bit edge connector footprint

### Removed

- 0.1uF capacitor near the shift register

## v0.5 (18 June, 2024)

### Added

- Pads under the rings on the edge connector footprint
- Mechanical holes for the bumper buttons
- All footprint pads now account for soldermask expansion of 0.038mm
- Battery holder on the back of the PCB, along with a switch

### Changed

- Made larger pads for shift register and NeoPixels
- Corrected the version number printed on the board from v1.4 (from previous v0.4) to v0.5
- Removed copper underneath the Devices Lab logo for better adhesion
- Renamed and reorganised imported symbols and footprints
- Fixed the shoulder buttons to include a mechanical through hole for better support

### Removed

- Lancaster cityscape on the back of the PCB, to make space for the battery pack
- Manufacturer's links in the footprints

## TODO

- [ ] Make the thermal relief smaller everywhere on the GND plane
- [x] Ask Joe to label skilkscreen to start with ZERO, and probably call it L, rather than like the refernece designator "D"
- [x] Move the Edge_Cut further away from the rings
- [x] Ensure the B_Mask does not overlap with where the microbit will rest
- [x] Remove the notches for on the MB footprint
- [x] Place all designators udner the components - good habits for (switch, shift register)
- [x] Rotate all designators to the same direction (horizontal)
- [x] Make triangles bigger, to match the MB labels
- [x] Center the key hole
- [x] Add labels for ON/OFF
- [x] Make switch footprint pads a little bigger
- [ ] Make is so that the DPDT slide switch can switch between battery power and micro:bit power
- [x] Bold devices lab logo
- [x] Change fonts to Segoe UI
- [x] Battery holder alterations
  - [x] SMT footprint on the back
  - [-] (In the next version) add JST connector footprint
  - [-] (In the next version) add U/C slots for rubber bands
- [x] Add Schottky diode to prevent the current running from micro:bit to the battery
  - https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/tree/main/electronics/generic/suggested-components
  - https://tech.microbit.org/hardware/powersupply/
- [x] Rewire power lines, to adjust for the new diode and DPDT switch
- [x] Change the BATTERY/MICRO:BIT silkscreen writing to icons
- [x] Make the contact pads for screws wider on the front

## New BOM

- Slide switch [C2906280]
- SMD battery holder [C964881]
- Schottky diode [C37704]

## Future BOM items

- Loose battery holder with JST male connector [source later]
- JST S2B-PH-SM4-TB female connector [C295747]
