- Two more buttons for a complete D-pad

### Changed

- Moved the X/Y buttons into a diagonal layout
- Improved the micro:bit edge connector
- New silkscreen labels and font
- Made the entire PCB larger to accommodate the new and improved micro:bit edge connector footprint

### Removed

## v0.5 (18 June, 2024)

### Added

- Pads under the rings on the edge connector footprint
- Mechanical holes for the bumper buttons
- All footprint pads now account for soldermask expansion of 0.038mm

  TODO:

- Battery holder on the back of the PCB

### Changed

- Made larger pads for shift register and NeoPixels
- Corrected the version number printed on the board from v1.4 (from previous v0.4) to v0.5
- Removed copper underneath the Devices Lab logo for better adhesion
- Renamed and reorganised imported symbols and footprints
- Fixed the shoulder buttons to include a mechanical through hole for better support

  TODO:

- New and improved layout
- Make the thermal relief smaller everywhere on the GND plane

### Removed

- Lancaster cityscape on the back of the PCB, to make space for the battery pack
- Manufacturer's links in the footprints
