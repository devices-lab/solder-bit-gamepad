## v0.2

### Added

- New and improved schematic with SMT
- First PCB layout with surface-mount footprints
- micro:bit edge connector footprint
- Silkscreen graphics similar to micro:bit triangles, labels for buttons

### Changed

- The positioning of the L/R buttons to in-line

### Removed

- Previous footprints with THT

## v0.3

### Added

- Lancaster cityscape graphic on the back of the PCB
- Two bumber buttons
- Larger pads (hand-solder version)

### Changed

- Renamed the buttons L/R to X/Y
- Modified micro:bit edge connector
- Placed X/Y buttons in a diagonal layout

### Removed

- Silkscreen graphics similar to micro:bit triangles

## v0.4

### Added

- Devices Lab logo and footprint
- Two more buttons for a complete D-pad

### Changed

- Moved the X/Y buttons into a diagonal layout
- Improved the micro:bit edge connector
- New silkscreen labels and font
- Made the entire PCB larger to accommodate the new and improved micro:bit edge connector footprint

### Removed

- 0.1uF capacitor near the shift register

## v0.5 (18 June, 2024)

### Added

- Pads under the rings on the edge connector footprint
- Mechanical holes for the bumper buttons
- All footprint pads now account for soldermask expansion of 0.038mm
- Battery holder on the back of the PCB, along with a switch

### Changed

- Made larger pads for shift register and NeoPixels
- Corrected the version number printed on the board from v1.4 (from previous v0.4) to v0.5
- Removed copper underneath the Devices Lab logo for better adhesion
- Renamed and reorganised imported symbols and footprints
- Fixed the shoulder buttons to include a mechanical through hole for better support

### Removed

- Lancaster cityscape on the back of the PCB, to make space for the battery pack
- Manufacturer's links in the footprints

## TODO

- [x] Make the thermal relief smaller everywhere on the GND plane (made spoke width 0.2mm and gap 0.75mm, from 0.25mm and 0.5mm, respectively)
- [x] Ask Joe to label skilkscreen to start with ZERO, and probably call it L, rather than like the refernece designator "D"
- [x] Move the Edge_Cut further away from the rings
- [x] Ensure the B_Mask does not overlap with where the microbit will rest
- [x] Remove the notches for on the MB footprint
- [x] Place all designators udner the components - good habits for (switch, shift register)
- [x] Rotate all designators to the same direction (horizontal)
- [x] Make triangles bigger, to match the MB labels
- [x] Center the key hole
- [x] Add labels for ON/OFF
- [x] Make switch footprint pads a little bigger
- [x] Make is so that the DPDT slide switch can switch between battery power and micro:bit power
- [x] Bold devices lab logo
- [x] Change fonts to Segoe UI
- [x] Battery holder alterations
  - [x] SMT footprint on the back
  - [-] (In the next version) add JST connector footprint
  - [-] (In the next version) add U/C slots for rubber bands
- [x] Add Schottky diode to prevent the current running from micro:bit to the battery
  - https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-ddk/tree/main/electronics/generic/suggested-components
  - https://tech.microbit.org/hardware/powersupply/
- [x] Rewire power lines, to adjust for the new diode and DPDT switch
- [x] Change the BATTERY/MICRO:BIT silkscreen writing to icons
- [x] Make the contact pads for screws wider on the front
- [x] Fix the groound edge connector back pad to clear the gap between it and the copper zone fill

## New BOM

- Slide switch [C2906280]
- SMD battery holder [C964881]
- Schottky diode BAT60B [C3018529]

## v0.6 (1 July, 2024)

- Corrected schematic for all capacitors to have value of 1uF (previously D3, D4, and D5 had capacitor values of 100nF)
- Removed copper from the machanical hole on the battery holder
- Created pads out of the copper polygons in the edge connector
- Created extra footprint for the left bumper button, due to a swapped pin orientation
- Added dimensions of the board in the User.1 layer
- Made the GND pad on B.Cu a little longer to enure good connection with the GND zone
- Change version numbers to v0.6

## v0.7

- Imporoved schematic labels and reference designators

### TODO

- [ ] Rename SW7 and SW8 to S7 and S8 in layout
- [ ]

## Future BOM items

- Loose battery holder with JST male connector [source later]
- JST S2B-PH-SM4-TB female connector [C295747]
